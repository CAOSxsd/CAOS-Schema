    <!-- Purpose of CAOS schema: To catalog artists as they portray themselves on social media platforms, such as Instagram, meaning the artwork they display, how they display their artwork, and the processes they display on social media. 
        This schema is intended to document the provenance of the artists’ artistic process on social media and understand their activity and popularity on these platforms. 
        This schema is intended to be just one piece of information about the artist within the realm of social media platforms, especially Instagram, this is not intended to be the sole source of metadata about he artist. 
        This schema makes the assumption that there is other metadata records about the artist that goes into more detail about other aspects of the artist and their artwork, this schema focuses on information about the artist’s activity and persona on social media. -->
    
    <!-- Intended Audience of CAOS schema: This schema is intended to be used by institutions such as art museums, art galleries, archives, and special collections. 
        With this audience in mind, this schema makes assumptions that some catalogers will have specialized training in art and cataloging, while others might have minimal in-depth training in these fields. 
        The schema is designed to have multiple optional fields, so that the cataloger may develop a record that suits the purpose and knowledge of the cataloger. -->

                                        LinkedInstitution: This element is intended to describe the main institution that the artist is associated with and/or the institution associated with requesting the catalog record of this artist.
                                        For instance, the artist is mostly associated with one Art Museum and so this is the main institution that the cataloger wants to be linked to artist.
                                        Another example would also be that the creator of this record is associated with an institution that is linked to the artist, and so the catalog wants to highlight this link.
                                        If institution is linked in this element, then it does not also need to be described in the artistRelationship element too.

                                        The intention of this element is to give a space to describe in a short word/sentence why this artist might be cataloged or why they matter in the space of the cataloging institution.
                                        Such as one value could be "up-and-coming", which would show that this artist is a promising candidate and they are still early in their artist career, so it might be beneficial to catalog their artist provenance in their early stages of their art career.

                                        It is important to be able to quickly describe the post for understanding the artist's process, for instance a post type could be "in progress" or "sketch" to show that this artwork is not yet completed. 
                                        This is good element to show the provenance of the artist process in creating a certain artwork.

                                        For instance, if an artist decided to change the type of medium they worked with and the cataloger wanted to document the artist's shift in style, then they could include an event that describes how the artist began using a different medium in this social media post and why it is significant to artist's work.

This is different from ArtistRelationships, because this element's purpose is to represent other relationships between the post. 
                                                    For instance, within the post, the artist may be having a promotional event for their artwork being displayed somewhere that was originally not linked to them. So this would be a useful relationship to show how this social media post is promoting the artist's artwork at a different institution.
